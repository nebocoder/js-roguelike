# Macabre Descent

## You can now play the game at [this link](https://nebocoder.github.io/js-roguelike/).

Roguelike made using vanilla JS.
Game was made following [Javascript Broughlike Tutorial](https://nluqo.github.io/broughlike-tutorial/index.html), the idea is to improve the original code and create a more engaging game. This project is also a chance for me to explore GitHub workflow as this is the first project I'm working on thats going on here.

Project TODOs:
- [ ] Refactor code
- [ ] Improve project structure
- [ ] Improve game art and sounds
- [ ] Add features (monsters, better progression etc.)
- [ ] Host the game online properly
